# Payload

Payload is a lightweight framework for specifying, injecting, and using
dependencies in Ruby on Rails applications. It facilitates run-time assembly of
dependencies and makes it plausible to use [inversion of control] beyond the
controller level. It also attempts to remove boilerplate code for common
patterns such as defining factories and applying decorators.

Overview
--------

The framework makes it easy to define dependencies from application code without
resorting to singletons, constants, or globals. It also won't cause any
class-reloading issues during development.

The central object in the framework is a "container." Dependencies are specified
using Ruby configuration files. Configured dependencies are then available
anywhere a reference to the container is available.

Define simple dependencies in `config/dependencies.rb` using services:

```ruby
service :payment_client do |container|
  PaymentClient.new(ENV['PAYMENT_HOST'])
end
```

The configuration block receives a reference to the container, which will
contain all configured dependencies. This makes it possible to define
dependencies without knowing how or when their sub-dependencies will be defined.

Controllers receive a reference named `dependencies`, so you can easily inject
dependencies into controllers.

For example, in `app/controllers/payments_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    payment = Payment.new(params[:payment], dependencies[:payment_client])
    receipt = payment.process
    redirect_to receipt
  end
end
```

You can easily test this dependency in a controller spec:

```ruby
describe PaymentsController do
  describe '#create' do
    it 'processes a payment' do
      payment_params = { product_id: '123', amount: '25' }
      client = stub_service(:payment_client)
      payment = double('payment', process: true)
      Payment.stub(:new).with(payment_params, client).and_return(payment)

      post :create, payment_params

      expect(payment).to have_received(:process)
    end
  end
end
```

You can further invert control and use factories to hide low-level dependencies
from controllers entirely.

In `config/dependencies.rb`:

```ruby
factory :payment do |container|
  Payment.new(container[:attributes], container[:payment_client])
end
```

In `app/controllers/payments_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    payment = dependencies[:payment].new(attributes: params[:payment])
    payment.process
    redirect_to payment
  end
end
```

You can also stub factories in tests:

```ruby
describe PaymentsController do
  describe '#create' do
    it 'processes a payment' do
      payment_params = { product_id: '123', amount: '25' }
      payment = stub_factory_instance(:payment, attributes: payment_params)

      post :create, payment_params

      expect(payment).to have_received(:process)
    end
  end
end
```

The controller and its tests are now completely ignorant of `payment_client`,
and deal only with the collaborator they need: `payment`.

Setup
-----

Add payload to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'payload'
```

To access dependencies from controllers, include the `Controller` module:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Payload::Controller
end
```

Specifying Dependencies
-----------------------

Edit `config/dependencies.rb` to specify dependencies.

Use the `service` method to define dependencies which can be fully instantiated
when the application boots:

```ruby
service :payment_client do |container|
  PaymentClient.new(ENV['PAYMENT_HOST'])
end
```

Other dependencies are accessible from the container:

```ruby
service :payment_notifier do |container|
  PaymentNotifier.new(container[:mailer])
end
```

Use the `factory` method to define dependencies which require dependencies from
the container as well as runtime state which varies per-request:

```ruby
factory :payment do |container|
  Payment.new(container[:attributes], container[:payment_client])
end
```

The container for factory definitions contains all dependencies defined on the
container as well as dependencies provided when instantiating the factory.

Use the `decorate` method to extend or replace a previously defined dependency:

```ruby
decorate :payment do |payment, container|
  NotifyingPayment.new(payment, container[:payment_notifier])
end
```

Decorated dependencies have access to other dependencies through the container,
as well as the current definition for that dependency.

Using Dependencies
------------------

The Railtie inserts middleware into the stack which will inject a container into
the Rack environment for each request. This is available as `dependencies` in
controllers and `env[:dependencies]` in the Rack stack.

Use `[]` to access services:

```ruby
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    dependencies[:payment_client].charge(params[:amount])
    redirect_to payments_path
  end
end
```

Use `new` to instantiate dependencies from factories:

```ruby
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    payment = dependencies[:payment].new(attributes: params[:payment])
    payment.process
    redirect_to payment
  end
end
```

The `new` method accepts a `Hash`. Each element of the `Hash` will be accessible
from the container in `factory` definitions.

Grouping Dependencies
---------------------

You can enforce simplicity in your dependency graph by grouping dependencies and
explicitly exporting only the dependencies you need to expose to the application
layer.

For example, you can specify payment dependencies in
`config/dependencies/payments.rb`:

```ruby
service :payment_client do |container|
  PaymentClient.new(ENV['PAYMENT_HOST'])
end

service :payment_notifier do |container|
  PaymentNotifier.new(container[:mailer])
end

factory :payment do |container|
  Payment.new(container[:attributes], container[:payment_client])
end

decorate :payment do |payment, container|
  NotifyingPayment.new(payment, container[:payment_notifier])
end

export :payment
```

In this example, the final, decorated `:payment` dependency will be available in
controllers, but `:payment_client` and `:payment_notifier` will not.

You can use this approach to hide low-level dependencies behind a facade and
only expose the facade to the application layer.

Testing
-------

To activate testing support, require and mix in the `Testing` module:

```ruby
require 'payload/testing'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include Payload::Testing
end
```

During integration tests, the fully configured container will be used. During
controller tests, an empty container will be initialized for each test. Tests
can inject the dependencies they need for each interaction.

This module provides two useful methods:

* `stub_service`: Injects a stubbed service into the test container and returns
  it.
* `stub_factory_instance`: Finds or injects a stubbed factory into the test
  container and expects an instance to be created with the given attributes.
